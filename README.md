## CLI wordle-like game in Java
Project submitted under homework 12 in CSDS 293 - Software Craftmanship class

### Features
- Game logic that mimics wordle: prompting the user to guess a word of a certain length, giving feedback on the accuracy of each letter. Three types of matches: perfect match (right letter at right place), partial match (right letter, wrong place), non-match (wrong letter)
- Test cases that cover the full codebase
- Ant build file to specify build and test targets
- Comments and Barricade architecture, adhering to best software craftmanship practices.
